# Lightweight and Robust Face Emotion Recognition Using Landmarks

This project provides a lightweight, real-time facial emotion recognition (FER) system using facial landmarks. By leveraging Googleâ€™s MediaPipe framework for landmark extraction, the system employs deep learning models to classify emotions efficiently, making it ideal for mobile or resource-constrained environments.

### Key Features:
- Real-time processing
- Robust to extreme facial poses
- Efficient landmark-based deep learning models
